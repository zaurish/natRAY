# natRAY

Hello!
This project was created by 964712. It's my first program when I was learning Python language - but it works!


Program was created to support analyse the same data like logs, nat, IP etc. This script compares data from both files and informs the user when correlations are found. For example: You have two files containing IP an you are looking for numbers that appear in both. This program will do it for you. Program has polish instruction and menu language.


If you want to use it you have to clone or download this repository.
You have to install Python no less than 3.x.


When you get them you have to paste to file "nat1.txt" firs objects. Each of them have to end with the Enter key.

Next paste to file "nat2.txt" second objects. They also have to end with the Enter key.

Run program double click in "Main.py".

Select 2 (second option).

After that you'll get the result.

In file "wynik.txt" will saved results.


If you have problem contact the creator.
